//! # atlas-Core
//!
//! `atlas-core` is the foundational library for a language creation tool designed to assist users in developing languages.
//! This core library currently serves as the building block for the creation of Atlas77, a functional programming language.
//!
//! Currently, it's only purpose is to generate a Lexer and the way to do it is pretty straightforward

/// Contain a powerful macro to generate a fully fledge lexer tailored to the user needs
pub mod lexer;
mod tests;
/// TODO
pub mod utils;
